### Colours and Fonts

#### Colours

The colours used on the site are:

[#572b9e] (Primary)
[#ffeafd] (Background light, text light)
[#8546e5] (Secondary)
[#653d73] (Background dark)
[#7a0ea0] (Accent)

Here is a screenshot of the palette from Cooolors:

![Colour palette](./documentation/design/sleep-healthily-palette.png)

#### Fonts

**Ingrid Darling** is chosen as the main title font for its elegant and inviting appearance. It embodies a sense of comfort and tranquility, which is perfectly suited for a sleepy theme. It sets a calming tone right from the first glance to encourage rest and relaxation.

**Inter** is used for headings. It is a highly readable typeface designed specifically for user interfaces. Its clean and neutral design ensures that headings are clear and easy to navigate, enhancing the usability of the site.Inter allows for a balance between aesthetic appeal and clarity.

I selected **Roboto** for body text because is a versatile and modern font that has great legibility. Longer texts such as product descriptions and user guides are easy to read and digest, which is important since there will be a blog on the site. Roboto's straightforward style supports the overall clean and user-focused design, making it an ideal choice for the body text.

### User flowchart

The user flowchart was created using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The flowchart shows the different paths that a user can take through the site.

## Development

### Site Features

Site features go here when developed

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The ERD is a visual representation of the database structure. It shows the tables, the columns in each table, and the relationships between the tables. Here is the ERD from my planning:
