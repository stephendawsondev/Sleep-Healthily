## Planning and Design

###  Opportunities

Being a Developer myself, I have a lot of feature ideas for the Stackportfol.io platform. I have listed them in the table below, rating them by their importance and difficulty. The rating system is based on the MoSCoW method of prioritisation.

| Feature                | Importance | Difficulty | Project priority |

## Development

### Site Features

Site features go here when developed

### Entity Relationship Diagram

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The ERD is a visual representation of the database structure. It shows the tables, the columns in each table, and the relationships between the tables. Here is the ERD from my planning:
